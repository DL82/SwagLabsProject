# SwagLabsProject
This is my test automation demo project.
I'm mostly self thought, participated a few years back in a course to learn basic Selenium with Java but all other frameworks and integrations incorperated here are from online courses and sources.
Project includes:
- TestNG annotations and Listeners class
- Maven
- TakeScreenshot on failure
- ExtentReports
- Log4j2
- DataProvider class
...

My intention is to keep working on this project, improve and learn new concepts and best practices through it.
